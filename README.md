## ABSTRACT

The dependency on computer-based technology has resulted in storage of lot of electronic data in the health care industry. As a result of which, health professionals and doctors are dealing with demanding situations to research signs and symptoms correctly and perceive illnesses at an early stage. However, Machine Learning technology have been proven beneficial in giving an immeasurable platform in the medical field so that health care issues can be resolved effortlessly and expeditiously. Disease Prediction is a Machine Learning based system which primarily works according to the symptoms given by a user. The disease is predicted using algorithms and comparison of the datasets with the symptoms provided by the user.

## CLASSIFIERS USED

MLP Classifier <br />
Decision Tree <br />
Random Forest Classifier <br />

## Implementation Architecture

## DATASETS

   Download the dataset fom the given link
      
   `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RLuaDOqiY2iZqi0f_jTSgPe5IhpRRvAX?usp=sharing`

   instead of entire training you can use the pre trained data set which is addressed Training.csv. 

## RESULT
   I have developed this and it can be implemented in the healthcare robot architecture that would be helpful for the doctors and technician to give and get the prediction of disease with the given symptoms.
